<h1>About Me</h1>

<h2 style="color: rgb(215, 129, 143)">Hello! I’m Pippa</h2>
<p>
  I’m a mom of two beautiful boys living in sunny Cape Town, South Africa. I am
  currently taking on Freelance WordPress development work while completing a
  Bachelors degree in Computer Science. With a strong psychology background, I
  hope to one day shift into a career within User Experience, human-computer
  interaction, and AI.
